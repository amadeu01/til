# TIL: Creating a Debounced AsyncStream from a Publisher in SwiftUI

## Problem
When working with `@Published` properties in SwiftUI, we often need to:
- Wait for a stable value before using it (**debounce**).
- Convert a `Publisher` into an `AsyncStream` for use with Swift Concurrency (`async/await`).
- Fetch only the **latest** value after a delay.

---

## Solution
We can create a **generic factory function** that converts any `Publisher` into an `AsyncStream`, applying a debounce delay.

```swift
import Combine
import Foundation

/// Creates an AsyncStream that emits the last value from a publisher after a debounce delay.
/// - Parameters:
///   - publisher: The upstream publisher.
///   - debounceTime: The debounce delay before emitting the last value.
///   - scheduler: The scheduler to use for debouncing (default: `RunLoop.main`).
/// - Returns: An AsyncStream that provides the last value after the debounce delay.
func debouncedAsyncStream<T: Publisher>(
    from publisher: T,
    debounceTime: TimeInterval,
    scheduler: any Scheduler = RunLoop.main
) -> AsyncStream<T.Output> where T.Failure == Never {
    AsyncStream { continuation in
        var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
        
        publisher
            .debounce(for: .seconds(debounceTime), scheduler: scheduler)
            .sink { value in
                continuation.yield(value)
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}
