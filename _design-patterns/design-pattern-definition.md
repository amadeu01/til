# Design Patterns

> “Sets of repeatedly applied design rules are called design patterns ”
>
> Excerpt From: Chris Eidhof. “App Architecture.” iBooks.

> In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
> A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Creational patterns

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that
> deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
> suitable to the situation.
> The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added
> complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by
> somehow controlling this object creation.

## Structural Patterns

> In Software Engineering, Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns
> that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

## Behavioral Patterns

> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify
> common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
> By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
