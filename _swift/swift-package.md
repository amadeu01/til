# Swift Package

Once, I had to work with node and also with `npm`. Then, I found myself looking at
`Swift Package` which is like *npm*, but for swift code base. It still has a lot of work to be done,
however it makes its job well.

It is like a "npm" without "npm install", but it installs dependencies and it is a nice alternative for `cocoapods` and `carthage`.
It still has its limitations, however it is native for swift diferent from `cocoapods` that mess around with your project workspace.
