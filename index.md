# My TILs

This is a collection of concise write-ups of small things I've learned day to day across a variety of languages and technologies.
These are mostly things I learn by pairing with smart people or reading some cool stuff on any website/blog/medium.

Make no mistake, those information were written to Amadeu on the future, so I can remember how I ended up with some thought and so
I can find out about my early learnings on something. Feel free to enjoy my journey on learning stuff ðŸ¤©
