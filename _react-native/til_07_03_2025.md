# TIL: State Management and Architecture in React Native

Today I learned how to effectively handle state management and choose a suitable architecture for React Native applications. Here's a concise breakdown of key insights:

## 1. Global App State (Authentication, Session, User Info)

For managing global state such as authentication or user session, the state solution should be:
- **Predictable**
- **Centralized**
- **Consistent**

### Recommended Solutions:
- **Redux Toolkit** (highly structured, predictable, and scalable)
- **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** (simple, minimalistic, less boilerplate)
- **Context API** (suitable for simple cases)

**Best Overall Recommendation**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

## 2. Component-Level (Local) State

For local component state:
- Use built-in React hooks: `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`.
- Prefer `useReducer` for complex state logic.

**Best Practice**: Always start simple (`useState`) and scale up if necessary.

## 3. Components Mutating Global State

To maintain global state integrity:
- Components should dispatch actions (Redux) or call clearly defined setter functions (Zustand).
- Avoid direct mutation of global state.

## 4. Protecting Global State from Excessive Mutation

To prevent abuse or over-mutation of global state:
- Use clearly defined action creators or encapsulated setters.
- Leverage TypeScript to enforce mutation constraints.
- Minimize exposed mutation methods to essentials only.

## MVVM Architecture in React Native

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is typically used in frameworks like Xamarin or Android, but it can be adapted in React Native effectively:

- **Model**: Data layer (APIs, databases).
- **View**: React Native components.
- **ViewModel**: Custom hooks encapsulating UI logic and state interactions.

### Practical MVVM Implementation Example:
```jsx
// UserViewModel.js
export const useUserViewModel = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);
  
  const login = (credentials) => loginUser(credentials).then(setUser);
  
  return { user, login };
};

// Component.js
const UserProfile = () => {
  const { user, login } = useUserViewModel();
  
  if (!user) return <Loading />;
  return <Profile user={user} />;
};
```

**Pros of MVVM:**
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Easier logic testing independent of UI.

**Cons:**
- Potential complexity if overused.

## Alternative Architectures

- **Flux/Redux Architecture**: Action → Dispatcher → Store → View
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between data, domain, and presentation.
- **Feature-based Architecture**: Modules organized by feature (auth, payments, profile).

### Recommended Architecture:
- Small-Medium Projects: **Zustand + MVVM-inspired hooks**
- Medium-Large Projects: **Redux Toolkit + Feature-Based or Clean Architecture**

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Recommended Approach |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Global state** | Redux Toolkit or [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) |
| **Component state** | `useState`, `useReducer`, MVVM-inspired hooks |
| **Mutations** | Dispatch actions or setters |
| **State protection** | TypeScript, encapsulation |
| **Architecture** | MVVM-inspired (small/medium), Redux Toolkit + Feature-based (medium/large) |

These insights provide a clear foundation for scalable, maintainable, and predictable React Native applications.
